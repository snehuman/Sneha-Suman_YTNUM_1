# Problem Statement 1 - Mindful Watching Without Killing Engagement
Redesign YouTube’s mobile viewing experience to discourage compulsive binge-watching—but in a way that doesn’t negatively affect engagement or retention. Your design should subtly influence user behavior through interface alone (no backend logic), preserving the dopamine-driven flow of content consumption.

*My Solution*
We all know how difficult it is to leave addiction so, how about, making a feature such that a user can decide a number of videos they want to see, with an approximation of the whole watch time they want to maintain. Since, watching addiction is very addictive, but gradually minimizing it help. 

When a video exceeds the total watch time decided by the user, there's a warning to not to see that video, and suggesting different videos on the same topic, but with less number of watch time. And when the user exceeds the number of videos to be watched, no more new videos are suggested except the ones they have already watched.
